1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Project Name    : AutoMarketer AI
Type            : Web-Based AI-Powered Marketing Automation Platform
Category        : Final Year Project (FYP)
Current Stage   : Frontend Development Complete (React + TypeScript)
AI Model        : Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot AI) via Hugging Face Inference API
Backend         : n8n Webhook Integration (planned) / Mock Mode (active)

AutoMarketer AI is an intelligent marketing automation platform that leverages
artificial intelligence to help businesses and marketers create, manage, and
optimize their digital marketing campaigns. The platform uses Moonshot AI's
Kimi K2.5 large language model through the Hugging Face Inference API to
provide AI-powered features such as content generation, competitor analysis,
audience profiling, and lead scoring.

The frontend is fully built using React 19, TypeScript, and Vite, with a
modern dark/light theme design system. The AI integration layer is designed
with a dual-mode architecture — it can run in MOCK MODE (returning simulated
AI responses for demos) or LIVE MODE (sending real requests to the AI model).


================================================================================
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

Small and medium businesses face significant challenges in digital marketing:

- Creating engaging content across multiple social media platforms is
  time-consuming and requires specialized expertise.
- Understanding competitors' strategies and identifying market opportunities
  requires expensive tools and manual research.
- Scoring and qualifying leads requires intuition and experience that
  small teams often lack.
- Building detailed audience personas for targeted campaigns is complex
  and resource-intensive.
- Managing campaigns across channels (email, social, search) requires
  multiple disconnected tools.

AutoMarketer AI addresses these challenges by providing an all-in-one
AI-powered platform that automates and optimizes the entire marketing workflow.


================================================================================
3. OBJECTIVES

Primary Objectives:
  1. Develop an AI-powered marketing content generation system using the
     Kimi K2.5 model that can create platform-specific social media posts.
  2. Build an intelligent competitor analysis tool that performs automated
     SWOT analysis using AI reasoning.
  3. Implement AI-driven audience persona generation to help marketers
     understand and target their ideal customers.
  4. Create an AI lead scoring system that automatically evaluates and
     ranks potential customers based on their engagement data.

Secondary Objectives:
  5. Design a modern, responsive web interface with dark/light theme support.
  6. Implement a campaign management system with CRUD operations.
  7. Build a content optimization engine that improves existing marketing copy.

7. FEATURE BREAKDOWN (ALL 16 FEATURES)
================================================================================

Features are categorized into three tiers based on their AI integration:

TIER 1: AI-POWERED FEATURES (Core - Use Kimi K2.5)
---------------------------------------------------
These features directly call the AI service and represent the core innovation
of the project.

  1. CONTENT STUDIO (Content Generator)
     - Route: /generate
     - AI Functions Used: generateMarketingCopy(), generateCampaignStrategy(),
       generateSeoKeywords(), optimizeContent(), generateMarketingImage()
     - Description: The main AI workstation. Users input a topic, select
       platform (Twitter/LinkedIn/Instagram/Facebook), choose a tone
       (Professional/Casual/Humorous/Urgent/Inspirational), specify target
       audience, and the AI generates platform-optimized marketing posts.
     - Sub-features:
       a) Post Generation - Creates social media posts
       b) Campaign Strategy - Generates full marketing strategies

================================================================================
8. AI INTEGRATION DETAILS (Kimi K2.5 VIA HUGGING FACE)
================================================================================

FILE: src/services/aiService.ts (224 lines)

The AI service uses a SINGLETON PATTERN with the ApiClient class. It operates
in two modes controlled by the REACT_APP_USE_MOCKS environment variable:

MODE 1: MOCK MODE (Default - REACT_APP_USE_MOCKS=true)
-------------------------------------------------------
- Returns realistic pre-built mock data after a simulated delay
- Delays vary per function to simulate "thinking" time:
  - generateMarketingCopy()    : 1500ms delay
  - generateCampaignStrategy() : 4000ms delay (simulates deep thinking)
  - analyzeLeadScore()         : 2500ms delay
  - analyzeCompetitor()        : 4000ms delay (simulates deep thinking)
  - optimizeContent()          : 1500ms delay
  - generateAudiencePersona()  : 3500ms delay
  - generateSeoKeywords()      : 3000ms delay
  - generateMarketingImage()   : 3000ms delay

MODE 2: LIVE MODE (REACT_APP_USE_MOCKS=false)
---------------------------------------------
- Sends HTTP POST requests to n8n webhook URL
- n8n workflow routes the request to Hugging Face Inference API
- Uses Kimi K2.5 model (moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5) for text generation
- Falls back to mock data if the API call fails (graceful degradation)
- Request format: JSON with { action: string, ...payload }

API FUNCTIONS:
+----------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+
| Function Name              | Action ID        | Returns                   |
+----------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+
| generateMarketingCopy()    | generate_copy    | string[] (3 posts)        |
| generateCampaignStrategy() | generate_strategy| CampaignStrategy object   |
| analyzeLeadScore()         | analyze_lead     | {score, reason}           |
| analyzeCompetitor()        | analyze_competitor| SwotAnalysis object      |
| optimizeContent()          | optimize_content | OptimizationResult object |
| generateAudiencePersona()  | generate_persona | Persona object            |
| generateSeoKeywords()      | generate_seo     | SeoResult object          |
| generateMarketingImage()   | (direct)         | Image URL string          |
+----------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+

ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION (.env):
- REACT_APP_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL : n8n production webhook endpoint
- REACT_APP_USE_MOCKS       : true/false toggle for mock mode
- HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN     : API authentication token for Hugging Face
- PORT                      : Development server port (default: 3000)

Step 4: AI analyzes the lead's engagement data
Step 5: Returns a score (0-100) and reasoning
Step 6: Score badge updates with color coding:
        - Green (80+): Hot lead
        - Yellow (60-79): Warm lead
        - Red (<60): Cold lead

10. USER AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
================================================================================

FILE: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx

The authentication system uses React Context API to manage user state
across the application.

Features:
- Login with email and password (mock authentication)
- Registration with name, email, and password
- Protected routes (redirect to /login if not authenticated)
- Persistent session state during browsing
- Logout functionality with redirect

Components:
- AuthProvider: Wraps the entire app with auth context
- useAuth(): Custom hook to access auth state and actions
- ProtectedLayout: Higher-order component that checks authentication

Flow:
  1. User visits any protected route
  2. ProtectedLayout checks isAuthenticated flag
  3. If not authenticated: redirects to /login
  4. User enters credentials on Login page
  5. On success: isAuthenticated = true, user object is set
  6. User is redirected to Dashboard (/)
  7. Auth state persists across page navigation


================================================================================

================================================================================

AutoMarketer AI is a comprehensive AI-powered marketing automation platform
built as a Final Year Project. The frontend demonstrates modern web
development practices including:

  - React 19 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
  - Feature-based modular architecture for scalability
  - AI service integration pattern with mock/live dual-mode
  - Responsive design with dark/light theme support
  - Lazy loading and code splitting for performance
  - Custom hooks for state management
  - Reusable UI component library

The project showcases the integration of large language models (Kimi K2.5
by Moonshot AI) into a practical business application, demonstrating how AI
can automate and enhance marketing workflows that traditionally require
significant human expertise and time.

The four core AI features (Content Generation, Audience Profiling, Competitor
Analysis, and Lead Scoring) form the innovative heart of the platform, while
the supporting features (Campaigns, Email, Scheduler, Analytics, etc.)
provide the complete ecosystem needed for a professional marketing tool.
